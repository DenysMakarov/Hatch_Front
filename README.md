# Hello) Thank you very much for considering me as a candidate for the position. Thanks also for an interesting task.

```bash
 - start: got the task in afternoon friday, but started to do on Saturday morning
 - end: Monday morning
```

## Description:
### FrontEnd:
#### technology:


        1 React.js
        
        2 Redux
        
        3 Saga
        
        4 Axios
        
        5 Sass

### BackEnd:
#### technology:

        1 Node.js
        
        2 Express.js
        
        3 Sequelize
        
        4 Postgres

        5 AWS RDS
        
        6 AWS EC2
        
        7 AWS Amplify



## requirements:

#### All is done


## optional:
    + back-end the front-end is updating in 1 minute
    + added features : 1) update title, 2) delete todo by id
    + deploy on EC2 and amplify AWS (last update: 2023-04-25: because my aws free account no longer supports free deployment(, the project has been replaced with netlify and render)
    + database located on AWS RDS

    - did not have enough time to create test cases unfortunately(


## In addition:
Initially, I created hooks to get data but eventually, I made a decision to use Redux and Saga to keep state in the store. Not sure what is a better way, and it would be very interesting to know your opinion about this
